# autoTagger v. 1.1
A small tool I'm building to help reduce the tagging time for my customer segmentation position at Signs.com.

INSTRUCTIONS: To use, double-click the autoTagger executable from the dist folder. You can copy/paste this anywhere and it will still work.

The console will prompt you for you Signs.com email login, passwords, and the date of which you want to fill in agent tags. It will then complete the task at hand.

Current Bugs: Small warning bug when putting in the wrong password.

Functionality: does what it is supposed to through an executable file on macOS and Windows.
